<h1>A report from the course DA377B Software Development for the Web</h1>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Web development is something I personally do not have much experience with, unless one counts setting up a page on Geocities in the late 1990s.  Developing a webpage was part of a project we completed as a group in Software Development 2, but this was not a subgroup I had any involvement with.</p>

<p>I did use GitHub as part of that project and other projects and have some familiarity with using push, pull, commit and merging.  I much prefer to use the GitHub desktop application rather than GitBash but I understand why it is important to learn the fundamental commands used in GitBash.  I would note too that GitBash is probably the more powerful tool, too, as when something goes awry using the desktop application – usually when merging – we resort to using GitBash.</p>

<p>TIL:</p>
<p>- Using text editors such as Visual Studio Code and Atom</p>
<p>- Using links in a text editor</p>
<p>- Forking a branch on Git</p>

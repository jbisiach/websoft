<h1>A report from the course DA377B Software Development for the Web</h1>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Web development is something I personally do not have much experience with, unless one counts setting up a page on Geocities in the late 1990s.  Developing a webpage was part of a project we completed as a group in Software Development 2, but this was not a subgroup I had any involvement with.</p>

<p>I did use GitHub as part of that project and other projects and have some familiarity with using push, pull, commit and merging.  I much prefer to use the GitHub desktop application rather than GitBash but I understand why it is important to learn the fundamental commands used in GitBash.  I would note too that GitBash is probably the more powerful tool, too, as when something goes awry using the desktop application – usually when merging – we resort to using GitBash.</p>

<h3>TIL:</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Using text editors such as Visual Studio Code and Atom</li>
    <li>Using links in a text editor</li>
    <li>Forking a branch on Git</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Getting into the HTML and CSS side of web development is, I must admit, more enjoyable than I would have thought.  Traditionally I have struggled with Java programming, and here we have a platform that incorporates the principles of object-oriented programming... but this seems more intuitive somehow.  This could also be attributed to the extensive tutorials freely available online.</p>

<p>Working exclusively in HTML and CSS thus far, I understand this is what's referred to as 'front-end' development, or development for those with a slightly more artistic persuasion than a mechanical one.  In that, one observation I would make is that front-end development can be a deceptive time-sink: when it came time to play around with font selection, I lost a whole hour just browsing fonts on Google.  Same thing when I started looking at background colours.</p>

<h3>TIL:</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Fundamentals of coding in HTML</li>
    <li>Fundamentals of coding using CSS</li>
    <li>Not spending an hour looking at fonts</li>
  </ul>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>This project saw us bringing together the three elements of HTML, CSS and javascript, and much more than that. This, being only the third assignment, provides a fairly steep learning curve in fetching from a remote source and incorporating events in javascript.</p>

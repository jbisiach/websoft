      <h2>S01</h2>
      <p>Although I have been using the web since the late 90s, web development is something I personally do not have
        much experience with... unless one counts setting up a page on Geocities in 1997. Developing a webpage was part
        of a project we completed as a group in Software Development 2, but this was not a subgroup I had much
        involvement with.</p>

      <p>I did use GitHub as part of that project and other projects and have some familiarity with using push, pull,
        commit and merging. I much prefer to use the GitHub desktop application rather than GitBash but I understand why
        it is important to learn the fundamental commands used in GitBash. I would note too that GitBash is probably the
        more powerful tool, too, as when something goes awry using the desktop application – usually when merging – we
        resort to using GitBash to walk back any conflicting changes.</p>

      <h2>S02</h2>
      <p>Getting into the HTML and CSS side of web development is, I must admit, more enjoyable than I would have
        thought. Traditionally I have struggled with Java programming, and here we have a platform that incorporates the
        principles of object-oriented programming... but this seems more intuitive somehow. This could also be
        attributed to the extensive tutorials freely available online.</p>

      <p>Working exclusively in HTML and CSS thus far, I understand this is what's referred to as 'front-end'
        development, or development for those with a slightly more artistic persuasion than a mechanical one. In that,
        one observation I would make is that front-end development can be a deceptive time-sink: when it came time to
        play around with font selection, I lost a whole hour just browsing fonts on Google. Same thing when I started
        looking at background colours.</p>

      <h2>S03</h2>
      <p>This project saw us bringing together the three elements of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and much more than that.
        This, being only the third assignment, provides a fairly steep learning curve in fetching from a remote source
        and incorporating events in JavaScript. As the nature of how one of the components was supposed to be
        implemented was changed and barely explained, learning how to do this proved to be a frustrating experience.</p>

      <p>The flags component proved to be relatively simple once I formulated the obvious way to display several
        differnet flags using the one template in *.js. The concept was so simple, in fact, I am slightly embarassed at
        how long it took me to think of it.</p>

      <p>The duck component was also relatively simple; almost deceptively so. There are examples available that use a
        ton of code and there are extremely spartan examples such as the one I went with that essentially do the same
        thing. This proved to be quite instructive in itself.</p>

      <p>Having no previous experience using client side JavaScript made this assignment very challenging. JavaScript
        itself works in much the same way as Java, but learning a new programming language is always challenging.</p>

      <p>For this assignment I believe Ifulfilled the requirements to earn a grade 5.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>S04</h2>
      <p>This was another challenging assignment as I did not have any previous experience with the tools Node.js, npm
        and Express. Node and Express seem to form a good framework to build larger and more interactive websites on so
        long as you have a decent plan as to the framework of the project.</p>

      <p>After reviewing the Section04 lectures and lab, I followed the tutourials on the Express website. The
        walk-throughs involving installation, application generation and basic routes proved to be instrumental in
        working out this assignment. The most challenging aspect was indeed the JavaScript and Node aspects, with the
        lottery program being relatively simple.</p>

      <p>In this assignment I aimed for grade 4.</p>

      <h2>S05</h2>
      <p>PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. I had not
        previously used PHP programming, but I considering PHP can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>generate dynamic page content</li>
        <li>create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server</li>
        <li>PHP can collect form data</li>
        <li>send and receive cookies</li>
        <li>add, delete, modify data in your database</li>
        <li>be used to control user-access, and</li>
        <li>encrypt data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>have no doubt I unknowingly used PHP every single time I surfed the web.</p>

      <p>Having just started using PHP, I can say I appreicate the fucntionality of it and its reliance on the
        principles of OOP, making it extremely useful. However, unlike other languages we have used so far, the code
        itself is almost impenetrable as far as reading it to the untrained eye. Unlike something like Java, where
        even a relative layman could have some idea of watch a method does, PHP seems to be written with the express
        intent on making it machine-readable only.</p>

      <p>The assignment proved to be a challenge considering the above-mentioned issues I had with learning PHP. I
        relied heavily on the assistance provdided in the lecuture and the lab, and in the examples provided in the
        websoft Git. I am aiming for grade 4.</p>

      <h2>S06</h2>
      <p>A cursory search of which programming language is the most popular or most used shows that there does not
        appear to be any consensus on the popularity of programming languages. <a
          href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a> says it’s Java followed by C and then Python, while <a
          href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages">Octoverse</a> say it’s JavaScript followed by Python, then
        Java. When dealing exclusively with of server-side programming languages for websites, <a
          href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language">W3Techs</a> states PHP is overwhelmingly
        the most used, but Google Trends currently puts in below Python, Java, JavaScript, and C.</p>

      <p>Looking at Google Trends over the last five years, the ‘interest over time’ index worldwide for C, PHP and
        JavaScript all remain relatively consistent. The two standouts here are Java, which reigned supreme in 2015 by a
        sizable margin, but had its lead gradually eroded by Python until early 2019, when the lead changed hands. It
        does seem that Python is going to be the programming language of the future as it is the only one that shows
        consistent growth over the last five years.</p>

      </script>

      <p>If I were to recommend a language/framework/technology to a potential employer for my next large project, my
        recommended language would have to be either Java or Python. Python may be the coming thing and experience with
        it is highly sought after in the job market, but Java is still widely used, consistently updated and one of the
        easier languages to learn.</p>

      <h2>S07</h2>
      <p>Here we have three three topics of .NET Core, C# and ASP.NET. The .NET Core is a extensive platform with a ton
        of potential uses since it runs in so many different environments. It does kind make me wonder why we haven't
        been learning .NET along side Java for the past two years.</p>

      <p>C# is is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It encompasses strong typing, lexically
        scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, class-based object-oriented, and component-oriented
        programming disciplines. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure
        (CLI). Again, it is a little frustrating that we're only touching on such a fundamental programming language
        after spending more than two years with Java.</p>

      <p>ASP.NET is a server-side web-application framework designed for web development made to allow programmers to
        build dynamic web sites, applications and services. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
        allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language such as C#. This, much like the
        other server-side technologies we have learned, is extremely challenging to learn for for the layman.</p>

      <p>The approach I took for this assignemnt was similar to the one I took with A04 and A05.</p>

      <h2>S08</h2>
      <p>In choosing three wbesites to analyse, tried to choose pages with three vastly different purposes. To that end,
        I chose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/">A news site</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dressmann.com/sv/webbutik/Kollektion-2XL-9XL/dressmann-xl/">An online store</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">A tech-basded tutorial site</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The tools I used to analyse the site performance were Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights and my browser's devtool
        tab. I conduceted this research on my own.</p>

      <h3>The Age news site</h3>
      <p>The Age is a news site from Melbourne, Australia. The site scored very low scores for performance on both
        Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. By both measures, the page takes several seconds to fully load and has a
        speed indes of more than 10 seconds.</p>
      <img src="img\theAge2.jpg" alt="The Age Lighthouse">
      <br>
      <img src="img\theAge3.jpg" alt="The Age PSI">
      <br>

      <p>This is further highlighted in by the network information in the devtools showing that this page took nealry
        10 seconds to load completely. The reason for this appears to be the sheer volume and size of the images being
        processed: the ones highlighted here ranged approximately between 200KB to 800KB. The page iteself is also
        extremlely long and refereshes itself periodically.</p>
      <img src="img\theAge.jpg" alt="The Age devtools">
      <br>

      <h3>Dressmann XL online store</h3>
      <p>Dressmann XL is an online men's clothing store. The site scored low scores for performance on both Lighthouse
        and PageSpeed Insights, although not as low as The Age. By both measures, the page takes several seconds to
        fully load but, curiously, The Age took less time time to load at first, although overall Dressmann XL performed
        better.</p>
      <img src="img\dressman2.jpg" alt="Dressmann Lighthouse">
      <br>
      <img src="img\dressman3.jpg" alt="Dressmann PSI">

      <p>The page's average performance can be explained the network information in the devtools, showing that this page
        took nealry
        3 seconds to load completely. The reason for this appears to be similar to The Age, that being the volume and
        size of the images being
        processed.</p>
      <img src="img\dressman.jpg" alt="Dressmann devtools">
      <br>

      <h3>w3schools web development tutorials</h3>
      <p>w3schools provides tutorials, resources and many services to anyone wanting to learn web development. The site
        scored highly scores for performance on both Lighthouse
        and PageSpeed Insights, especially when compared to the other two sites previously mentioned. By both measures,
        the page has a speed index of less than half of both Dressmann XL and The Age (2.6 seconds compared to The Age's
        11 seconds).</p>
      <img src="img\w33.jpg" alt="w3schools Lighthouse">
      <br>
      <img src="img\w3.jpg" alt="w3schools PSI">

      <p>The page's average efficiency can be explained the network information in the devtools, showing that this
        page's size and volume of pictures are relatively small, instead relying on text and decived such as sidebars
        containing dozen of links to other parts of the site rather than using one large page like The Age does.

      <h2>S09</h2>
      <p>I found this section paticualrly interesting as it is an branch of study I plan to follow when (if) I graduate.
        Namely, the field of network forensics. Being a veteran user of the internet, website security is something I
        often considering when using the web, but learning about it from the development is a real eye-opener. Up until
        now, the only security measures we implemented as part of application development was a three-chance login
        system and two-factor authentication. We did study a unit in Computer Security, but I really have liked to spend
        more time in this area of study, the being website secuirty from a developer's perspective in particular.</p>

      <p>Another aspect I found interesting was the OWASP Top Ten list, especially when comparing the list from 2013 to
        2017 and today.</p>

      <p>Some security issues or concerns from your my own experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Input sanitsing - This is something I don't usual consider when designing an applicaiton or lately a
          website, espeically considering 'injection flaws' has remained on the top of OWASP's Top Ten list since at
          least 2013.</li>
        <li>Using components with known vulnerabilities - At this stage of our programming experience, we are proabably
          more concerned with finding components and APIs that acutally work the way we want them to rather than being
          concerned with how secure they are.</li>
        <li>Insufficient logging and monitoring - As with the previous issues, this is something I have not considered
          when building applicaitons and website during the course. Indeed, unless an attack came that was obvious, such
          as changing an interface, recognising and resposnding to an attack would be something I would be largely
          unprepared for. I would have really liked to exlpore this more in this unit.</li>

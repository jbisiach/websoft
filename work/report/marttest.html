        <h2>S01</h2>
        <p>The general techniques of Git and GitHub were know to me, I had never worked with GitHub Pages before. I had
            also never fokrked a repository before. I have worked on repositories with other people and by myself
            before, but never used the forking functionality, always just branching. I have never worked with Markdown.
            I have never attached tags to any commit before.</p>
        <p>I have created several small websites using html and css. These were mostly to support programming with
            php.</p>
        <p>I have created several small web applications. I have worked with php using things like loops and statements,
            nothing advanced. I have a little experience with inserting javascript code into html documents, but this
            knowledge is very limited. I have also used Java Servlets before to create web applications. I have also
            created a system using a REST architecture before.</p>
        <p>I learned to set up the GitHub Pages functionality. I also learned that an html page called index.html will
            be displayed if a folder is targeted that contains that html page. I learned to attach tags to commit to
            disply the release version of that commit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S02</h2>
        <p>I have some experience with html and css. I have made several website using html and an occasional one using
            css, although my css knowledge is very little. I have used JavaScipt once before and only in a single case.
            My JavaScript knowledge is absolutely minimal.</p>
        <p>According to MDN one can state that HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is used to
            determine the nature of different elements on a page and for a part how they are displayed. CSS defines the
            way elements are displayed and presented. It changes the rules of how to display the page. These rules can
            be used all over the page, it is not necessary to change things everwhere it is used. JavaScript describes
            the behaviour of web content. It can be used to make a page do things. It can also be used outside of web
            development.</p>
        <p>The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server for a specific page. The browser then returns an HTTP
            response which may contain the requested page in an HTML format for example.</p>
        <p>I learned some syntaxes for html (such as linking the stylesheet). I also learned about some semantic
            elements in HTML (such as header and footer). Finally I learned some syntax of css and roughly how it will
            influence the html page it is linked to.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S03</h2>
        <p>I did not really have any previous experience with using javascript in separate files. I had used javascript a little bit by directly inserting it into an html file. Furthermore, this code was borrowed from someone else and I did not fully understand it yet.</p>
        <p>JavaScript seems similar in basics to Java and php, regarding things like variables and such. In general it also seems pretty similar to Java, using objects with attributes and methods/functions and such.</p>
        <p>I took the assignment simply step by step. I started with all the requirements for grade 3 and then worked on to the grade 5 requirements. One of the trickier parts for me was getting the JSON files locally at the very start. After that just taking it step by step worked fine.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - How to set file preference in Chrome from XML to JSON</p>
        <p> - How to work with JavaScript objects, including setting parameter</p>
        <p> - How to create and specify transitions using CSS</p>
        <p> - How to parse and use JSON data in JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to use the fetch system to get data from different sources</p>
        <p> - How to use some functions of canvas elements in HTML</p>
        <p> - How to create a relatively dynamic object in HTML with the help of JavaScript</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S04</h2>
        <p>I did not have any previous experience with programming tools like node and npm.</p>
        <p>Node and Express seem to form a good framework to build larger and more interactive websites on. Node and Express are not easy to work with when you start out and need some practice to get working well. Things like getting the information in request headers takes some searching to find.</p>
        <p>I did not have any notable plan for the coding assignment. My usual way of doing these takes a few steps. First, I start with reading the lecture notes. Then I read the articles suggested (the Node and Express articles in this cas). After that I start with the actual assignment. When I get stuck I try to refer to the lectures or articles and after that I will search the Internet.</p>
        <p>I aimed for grade 5. The difference between the tasks for grade 4 and grade 5 was very small. The harder step was getting from grade 3to grade 4.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - The basics of working with npm, Node and Express</p>
        <p> - How to structure an express server using routers and middleware</p>
        <p> - How to fetch query data from http requests in an express router</p>
        <p> - How to add static webpages to an node/express server</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S05</h2>
        <p>I appreciate PHP. It allows for very modular design with it's include function. I also like how it is really
            easy to work it into your HTML file, since it can basically be placed anywhere on the page.</p>
        <p>PHP reminds me mostly of Python, as well as JavaScript a little. It feels very different from Java with
            declaring variables for example. The way it integrates in HTML is something I have not really seen
            before.</p>
        <p>I took pretty much the same plan as in the last coding exercise. For this one, however, the lectures I found
            were only in Swedish and therefore not very helpful.</p>
        <p>I (re-)learned:</p>
        <p> - How to use PHP in its basic form, declaring variables and such</p>
        <p> - How to split page into common parts and use those efficiently using PHP inclusion</p>
        <p> - How to run PHP with the XAMPP package</p>
        <p> - How to access the MySQL database in the XAMPP package</p>
        <p> - How to access MySQL using PHP</p>
        <p> - How to use URLs to pass data between PHP files</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S06</h2>
        <p>I think having popular programming languages is tremendously important and beneficial. The fact that most
            programmers will know these languages allows for great amounts of collaboration. This in itself is a great
            boon to the world of software development. If it would be possible, bringing all programming languages
            together to a few that suit all needs would be ideal.</p>
        <p>I am interested in programming languages for which I feel they suit the current need I have. In addition to
            this, I want the language to feel like I do not have to do things that feel unnecessary or redundant to make
            things work.</p>
        <p>See my comparison below. It looks like C++ interest has slowly been going down since the start of the
            comparison. The decrease in interest has slowed down in the recent years. There is a passing point around
            2012 where Python interest passed C++ interest, mostly because of the decrease of interest in C++.</p>
        <p><img src="img/comparison.png" width="400" alt="Comparison image"></p>
        <p>Since there are so many languages that I do not have experience with, it is hard to recommend one fully.
            There is simply so much that I don't know that it would feel quite close-minded to already recommend
            something. However, if I had to choose at this very moment I would most likely recommend PHP for it's
            capabilities as a server side programming language for web development.</p>
        <p>I don't feel I learned much in this section. The lectures were hard to follow by only reading since they are
            mostly key words. I suppose I have learned of the existence of a bunch of frameworks for JavaScript and
            PHP.</p>

        <h2>S07</h2>
        <p>.NET is a very extensive framework with a lot of built-in ways of interacting between components of a project. There is loads of support for things like dependecies and testing.</p>
        <p>Using .NET seems to allow for functional code pretty much EVERYWHERE in whatever you are creating. Languages like PHP are not so versatile as to be used in things like console apps etc.</p>
        <p>I took the same approach to the coding exercise as before. I aimed for grade 5.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - How to code in C#</p>
        <p> - How .NET generally works in regards of things like namespaces etc.</p>
        <p> - How to use the console in C# and .NET</p>
        <p> - How to create a web application in ASP.NET using the MVC template</p>
        <p> - How to generally use Razor pages</p>
        <p> - How to set up different actions in an ASP.NET MVC Controller</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>S08</h2>
        <p>I performed the analysis on my own. I chose the following three websites:</p>
        <p>Website 1: <a href="https://mightyteapot.tv/">https://mightyteapot.tv/</a></p>
        <p>Website 2: <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/">https://www.guildwars2.com/</a></p>
        <p>Website 3: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></p>
        <p>Website 1 is the personal website of a professional programmer. I am not sure whether this person is a professional web programmer or if they program other types of applications. Website 2 is the website of a (relatively) large video game company. This company most likely has professional web developers working on this website full-time. Website 3 is the website of GitHub, the leading online VCS platform in the world. As GitHub is a place to gather for programmers, they likely have access to some of the best programmers in the world. I expect there to be a team of expert web developers working on this website full-time.</p>
        <p>My data sheet can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17CAC7kWSPcjkokDql2JjdOnOULW_u2JHwhNBraC8Trc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>For the Lighthouse results I found the following: Website 1 had a very high performance score but scored lower than the other websites on the remaining criteria. Website 2 had similar results on the accessibility score. All wesites had a moderate average, with website 3 scoring the highest.</p>
        <p>For the Pagespeed Insights results I found the following: Website 1 had a very low overall score. It was the only website for which there was no field data available, so this might explain the low score. Website 1 also had a low score on the First Meaningful Paint of the page. Website 2 had a good score on the First Input Delay, which I also noticed when regularly loading the page.</p>
        <p>For the Chrome DevTools results I tested all pages on the Slow 3G setting. The loading times were vastly different, with website 2 having a very long load time. However, this page looked completely accessible very fast after reloading, so I suspect the long load is caused by components that are not necessary for the page to function.</p>
        <p>Regarding my test suite: I found Lighthouse especially interesting since it provides such a wide set of interesting data and improvement suggestions, from SEO to performance. The Chrome DevTools network area seemed interesting to be able to look at pages very specifically: what loads first? how will that look? etc. PageSpeed Insights seems to be really useful for giving meaningful suggestions for improving load speeds.</p>
		<p>Website 1 needs to look at their First Meaningful Paint, since it took quite a while for the page to be actually usable. Loading interactive elements first would be a good strategy to do this. I suggest both website 1 and website 2 look at their SEO, since these both had a lower score on that criteria. It could be improved by adding tags and similar components to the pages. Both pages would benefit from having a better SEO, since it will likely generate more traffic and more interest.</p>
		<p>I learned:</p>
		<p> - Of the existence of the three tools used in the above analysis</p>
		<p> - To interpret the results given by the tools</p>
		<p> - What the general criteria of a good website are in terms of performance</p>
		<p> - Some tips and tricks to improve website performance</p>

        <h2>S09</h2>
        <p>Issue 1: Input Sanitizing. This is something I don't do nearly enough. In the OWASP top ten this vulnerability is number 1.</p>
        <p>Issue 2: Having safe URLs in terms of redirecting and reading data from URLs. Also applicable when creating APIs. In my experience I quite often get data straight from the URLs (especially in some of the course assignments), which is not a good idea since this is very open to injection. In the OWASP top ten this would fall under injection (number 1) and possibly XSS (number 7).</p>
        <p>Issue 3: Serializing and deserializing of objects. This is something I had never even considered to be a vulnerability, and which makes it all the more dangerous. In the OWASP top ten this vulnerability is number 8.</p>
		<p>So the main guidelines I would give are: sanitize your input, practice the principle of least privilege, move any data through the safest possible channels, make sure you configure everything as safe as possible.</p>
		<p>I learned:</p>
		<p> - Of the existence of the OWASP top ten securtiy vulnerabilities</p>
		<p> - Roughly what each of the OWASP top ten entails and how to generally prevent them</p>
		<p> - Of the existence of several vulnerabilities that I'd never considered</p>
		<p> - That some of my practices are very unsafe</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Jonathon Bisiach, born in Adelaide, Australia. After leaving school I studied a Bachelor of Applied Science (Architectural Science) at Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University) in Darwin, and then later a Bachelor Arts (Professional Writing) at Victoria University in Melbourne.  I spent most of my career in Australia working in the public service, particularly in the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>After meeting my future-wife, a Swede travelling in Australia in 1997, I moved to Sweden in 2013 and we were married in 2014.</p>

<p>As long as I can remember, we always had a computer in our house as my father used one for work.  If memory serves me right, the first one I remember using was an IBM 386 with a turbo button.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy reading comics, brewing and drinking beer, and am an avid gamer.  I partuclarly enjoy space combat games, turn-based strategy, and well-written RPGs such as Dragon Age: Origins, The Elder Scrolls and The Witcher series.</p>

<p>Through participating in this course I hope I can gain this skills to make a website as good as the famous <a href=https://www.lingscars.com/>lingscars.com</a>.</p>
